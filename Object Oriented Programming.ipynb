    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - attributes\n",
    "    - behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "    - singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as <mark>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</mark>.\n",
